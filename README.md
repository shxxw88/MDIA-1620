### 3-2-1's Sept. 19 

**3 "aha" moments**
- The difference between git add and git commit is that *add* is for tracking and *commit* is to save the state of the file
- Strings is a sequence of characters
- Boolean is a logical data type that only result in 2 values of *true* or *false*
  
**2 things that are still unclear**
  - What is the definition of console.log and what it does?
  - How to incorporate HTML + CSS with JavaScript
    
**1 word for how I'm feeling at the moment**

*Happy*
